## CreateAI

The main function that creates an AI instance. It sets up:

- Actions (like submit) that can be called
- Initial UI state (what users see) 
- Initial AI state (conversation history)

Think of `createAI` like building a new toy robot:

- The robot needs instructions (actions) to know what to do
- It needs a face (UIState) so you can see what it's thinking
- It needs a brain (AIState) to remember your conversations
- When you create the robot, you give it all these things to start with






createStreamableUI
Used to create a stream of UI updates that can be modified in real-time. Think of it
like a live video stream, but for UI components:

eg:const uiStream = createStreamableUI()

// Update UI immediately
uiStream.update(<Component />)

// Add more content
uiStream.append(<AnotherComponent />)

// Mark stream as complete
uiStream.done()

const uiStream = createStreamableUI()

uiStream.update(<SearchResults results={searchResult.results} />)
Imagine you're drawing a picture:
createStreamableUI is like getting a magic paper that can change while you watch
uiStream.update is like drawing something new on the paper
uiStream.append is like adding more drawings to the bottom
When you're done drawing, you say uiStream.done()







createStreamableValue
Creates a value that can be updated over time, useful for showing progress or streaming text:
eg:
const streamText = createStreamableValue<string>()

// Update the value
streamText.update("New text")

// Mark as complete
streamText.done()
Think of this like a TV channel:
createStreamableValue is like turning on your TV
streamText.update is like changing what's showing on the TV
The TV keeps showing new things as they come in
When the show is over, you say streamText.done()





getMutableAIState
Gets a mutable version of the AI's state that can be updated:
eg:
const aiState = getMutableAIState<typeof AI>()

// Get current state
const currentState = aiState.get()

// Update state
aiState.update(newState)

// Mark as complete
aiState.done(finalState)

const aiState = getMutableAIState<typeof AI>()
aiState.update([...aiState.get(), newMessage])
This is like a robot's memory:
getMutableAIState is like opening the robot's memory box
aiState.get() is like looking at what's in the memory
aiState.update() is like putting new memories in
aiState.done() is like closing the memory box when you're finished







useUIState
Imagine a whiteboard that everyone can see:
useUIState is like getting permission to write on the whiteboard
messages is what's currently written on the whiteboard
setMessages is like getting a marker to write new things
When you write something new, everyone can see it right away
eg:
const [messages, setMessages] = useUIState<typeof AI>()






useAIState
This is like the robot's private notebook:
useAIState lets you read and write in the robot's notebook
aiMessages shows what's written in the notebook
setAiMessages lets you write new things in the notebook
The robot uses this notebook to remember your conversations
eg:
const [aiMessages, setAiMessages] = useAIState<typeof AI>()




useActions
Think of this like the robot's control buttons:
useActions gives you the remote control for the robot
submit is like pressing the "talk" button
When you press the button, the robot knows to do something
It's how you tell the robot to start working
eg:
const { submit } = useActions<typeof AI>()



experimental_streamText
Imagine the robot is writing you a letter:
Instead of waiting for the whole letter
You can see each word as the robot writes it
It's like watching someone write in real-time
You don't have to wait until they're finished to start reading
eg:
const result = await experimental_streamText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-4-turbo'),
  system: "You are a helpful assistant",
  messages
})


experimental_streamObject
This is like the robot building with blocks:
The robot builds something piece by piece
You can see each piece as it's added
The schema is like instructions for what to build
You watch it come together in real-time
eg:
await experimental_streamObject({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-4-turbo'),
  messages,
  schema: relatedSchema
})

    B --> C[Robot thinks]
    C --> D[Robot starts answering]
    D --> E[You see answer appear]
    E --> F[Robot remembers conversation]


It's like having a conversation with a friend who:
Listens to you (useActions)
Thinks about what you said (AIState)
Shows you their answer as they think (StreamableUI)
Remembers what you talked about (MutableAIState)
Keeps showing you new things (StreamableValue)

## AI State Management
  const initialAIState: {
    role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system' | 'function' | 'tool'
    content: string
    id?: string
    name?: string
  }[] = []

The application maintains an initialAIState array that stores messages with their
roles (user/assistant/system). This serves as the conversation history.


## Mutable AI State
    const aiState = getMutableAIState<typeof AI>()
    const uiStream = createStreamableUI()
    const isGenerating = createStreamableValue(true)
  
    const messages: ExperimentalMessage[] = aiState.get() as any
    const userInput = skip? `{"action": "skip"}`: (formData?.get('input') as string)
    const content = skip? userInput: formData? JSON.stringify(Object.fromEntries(formData)): null
    if (content) {
      const message = { role: 'user', content }
      messages.push(message as ExperimentalMessage)
      aiState.update([...(aiState.get() as any), message])

In the submit function, getMutableAIState is used to access and update the conversation state.
New messages are appended to the existing state using:

- Gets current messages
- Adds new user message
- Updates state with the combined messages



## UI State Management
  const [messages, setMessages] = useUIState<typeof AI>()
  const [aiMessages, setAiMessages] = useAIState<typeof AI>()

The ChatPanel component maintains two state arrays using hooks:
- useUIState for visual messages
- useAIState for the AI conversation history


## Messages rendered in ChatPanel
export function ChatMessages() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useUIState<typeof AI>()

  return (
    <>
      {messages.map((message: { id: number; component: React.ReactNode }) => (
        <div key={message.id}>{message.component}</div>
      ))}
    </>
  )
}

The ChatMessages component renders all messages from the UI state, maintaining the visual conversation
flow.




## State Updates During Interactions
    setMessages(currentMessages => [
      ...currentMessages,
      {
        id: Date.now(),
        isGenerating: false,
        component: <UserMessage message={input} />
      }
    ])

    const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget)
    const responseMessage = await submit(formData)
    setMessages(currentMessages => [...currentMessages, responseMessage as any])

The message is added to UI state
The message is processed through the AI
The response is added back to both UI and AI states
The key points about context maintenance are:
The application maintains two parallel states:
AI State: For maintaining the actual conversation history used by the AI
UI State: For rendering the visual representation of the conversation
Context is preserved through:
Persistent state management using getMutableAIState
Continuous appending of messages to existing state arrays
Synchronization between UI and AI states
